            Explanation of the purpose of each file in your repository 
On our Github repository, we have a couple of different files that are there for different reasons, they’re as follows;
README.md: This is where we will be uploading our documentation for this project.
Data.cvs: This cvs file was created to store the database that we are using for our project. This database contains customers’ names, emails, account numbers along with their balances.
Deposit_test.py: This is a test script that was created to run the deposit method.
Project_file.py: This is our main file, we used this file to create and store our code for the project.
Saving_test.py: This is a test script that was created to run the saving method.
Test.py: This was created to submit our first assignment to make sure everyone is able to collaborate via GitHub without any issues. No other use for this file.
Test_file.py: This where we first started to write out docstring, and plan out our project from the beginning. We then proceed to use project_file.py as the main file to write docstring, this file has no other use. 
Withdraw_test.py: This is a test script that was created to run the withdraw method.



            Instructions on how to run your program from the command line
Running our program from the command line is pretty easy, we have written out the steps below.
Step One: type in “python3 project_file.py”
Step Two: once you run our project file, you will be given 7 choices to select from.
Step Three: After you have made a selection, you will need to provide an account number you would like to add a deposit or whatever you wish to do. You’re able to obtain an account number from the CSV file.
Step Four: After you have chosen your account number, you will be asked how much you would like to deposit, withdraw or add to saving depending on your selection.
Step Five: After you're done, you will be given an option to choose whether you want a receipt or not. This is the last step.



            Instructions on how to use your program and/or interpret the output of the program, as applicable
The output of this program depends on your input for the selections required before. Depending on your selections, your output for this program will be a receipt entailing all the changes that transpired over the course of the program. Information entailed includes the user’s name, account, their original balance, the desired change, the new balance. All these changes will remain in the database until the user comes back and makes another change.
